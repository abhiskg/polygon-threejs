-The scene is a holder for everything we can see. You can think of it as a “tiny universe” in which all your 3D objects live.
-The very center of the scene is the point (0,0,0), also called the origin of the coordinate system.
-If the scene is a tiny universe, and the camera is a telescope pointed at that universe, then the renderer is an artist who looks through the telescope and draws what they see onto a <canvas>, incredibly fast. We call this process rendering, and the resulting picture is a render.

- MeshBasicMaterial material also ignores any lights in the scene and colors (shades) a mesh based on the material’s color and other settings which is great
